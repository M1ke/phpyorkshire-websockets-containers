# PHP Yorkshire 2019 - Real Time Workshop
## Pre-conference container build

Run `docker-compose build` to get the containers downloaded and built - best to handle this
before you set off for the conference to avoid any internet issues that may slow down or
break your builds. The build will contain 5 containers, quite similar to one another, and should
take maybe 10 minutes.
